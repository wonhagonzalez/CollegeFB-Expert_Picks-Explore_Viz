# Consulting Project
Presented here is an exploratory analysis of expert predictions on college football games conducted for a client as part of a consulting course. The purpose of this analysis was to not only gauge the successful predictions made by college football analysts and journalists, but to also gauge how well the experts predicted games, given how competitive the game was expected to be.  Money line data was incorporated in order to account for how difficult games are to predict.

## Shiny app
Additionally, a Shiny app was created following the analysis.  The R code for this is also included in this repository.

## Data
